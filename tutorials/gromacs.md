# GROMACS
 
 
GROMACS is a super fast software used to run molecular dynamics simulations. It's pretty solid when all the files are organized in place. My main problem with GROMACS is the amount of files that are generated. And it's overwhelming fast.....so hopefully this doc provides some insight into the mystery of GROMACS.

Scenario: I have a small molecule that I need to prepare to run a simulation in water and see what happens. 

## 1.) Preparing a simulation for GROMACS

The molecule we are going to prepare today is `chitosan`. If you aren't familiar with that project then head over to the Chitosan github repository or the wiki page.
